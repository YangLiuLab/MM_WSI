# A multi-modal whole-slide image processing pipeline for quantitative mapping of tissue architecture, histopathology, and tissue microenvironment

This multi-modal image processing pipeline is for comprehensive spatial tissue profiling that combines quantitative phase microscopy for tissue architecture mapping, hyper-plex fluorescence imaging for tissue microenvironment profiling and whole-slide histopathology.

More information about the details of the code is available in the user guide. The example data is available in the “Example_data” folder at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14838554. This code also requires a set of self-generated correction maps for flat-field correction. The detailed steps are described in the method section of the manuscript. The example correction map from our system is provided at under “Correction_maps” folder at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14838554, or unzip the folder "correction_map" under "subfunctions".
