# A multi-modal whole-slide image processing pipeline for quantitative mapping of tissue architecture, histopathology, and tissue microenvironment

This multi-modal image processing pipeline is for comprehensive spatial tissue profiling that combines quantitative phase microscopy for tissue architecture mapping, hyper-plex fluorescence imaging for tissue microenvironment profiling and whole-slide histopathology.
